# Count me in


Picture this. You load up Spotify to play along to your favourite song, you click play
and rush to grab your instrument. By the time you're comfortable, the song's already
half-way through that sweet riff you wanted to play along to. Frustrating, right?

Count Me In adds an extra measure of beats prior to the song playing, giving the
user room to breath before their next big performance.
